# Saturn

___A low-level, general purpose application framework for the Nintendo GBA___

## About the project

__Saturn__ aims at providing the bare necessities for all sorts of projects
built on the _Game Boy Advance._ It is written in C++, and will provide a nice
object-oriented interface for manipulating the GBAâ€™s hardware with ease.

Here is a short list of some of the things Saturn hopes to provide:

- Classes and functions that make working with graphics more human
- A frame-based asynchronous task system
- A mainloop complete with a modifiable set of purposed callbacks
- A console interface that switches between input and output upon Select
- More abstractions for key input, sound, and link cable networking

## Free software

any way you please, without restriction. To be specific, Saturn is released
