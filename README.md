___A general-purpose game engine for the Nintendo® Game Boy Advance™___

## About

__Saturn__ aims at providing a plethora of functionality and toolsets for
building 2D video games on the _Nintendo Game Boy Advance._ It is written in a
mixture of C, C++ and assembly, and will provide an Entity–Component–System
framework for building applications.

Here is a short list of some of the things Saturn hopes to provide:

- Classes and functions that make working with graphics more human
- A frame-based asynchronous task system
- A mainloop complete with a modifiable set of purposed callbacks
- A console interface that switches between input and output upon Select
- More abstractions for key input, sound, and link cable networking
- a dual-mode topdown graphics layout, either on a grid or unrestricted, plus a
  sidescrolling platformer layout
- A collection of PC utilities that help make creating Saturn projects easier
- A fully automated and distributed build system used to build GBA titles as
  well as the engine itself
